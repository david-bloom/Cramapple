## Beta Revised-Answer Scoring Bug Logged - 2026-06-16

**Surface:** `https://cramapple-beta.lovable.app/beta`
**Status:** Patch Prompt Drafted
**Summary:** Confirmed by manual walkthrough on the Photosynthesis light
reactions FRQ that a coached revision targeting a single missed criterion
returns `Predicted: +0   Actual: +0` and leaves the revised total unchanged
even when the revision plainly satisfies the targeted criterion. Root cause
hypothesis: the revision is graded in isolation against the full rubric, so
it silently loses credit on criteria the original earned. Recommended fix
is targeted-criterion grading: grade the revised text only against the
clicked criterion and carry every other per-criterion decision forward
from the immutable original, then recompute the total. The comparison panel
must also expose original total, revised total, per-criterion delta,
predicted gain, and observed gain. Drafted
`prompts/LOVABLE_BETA_FIX_REVISION_SCORING.md` with the bug, the (b)
grading semantics, the updated comparison fields, and an acceptance check
requiring `REVISED (3/4)` with `+1` on the reproduction.

**Next Owner:** Lovable patch operator, then David Bloom for verification
**Next Required Action:** Apply the patch prompt to the beta, rerun the
documented walkthrough, and confirm both the gain case and the
no-improvement case behave as specified before any further beta use.

## Content Authoring and Revision Workbench Design Started - 2026-06-15

**Task:** UX-003
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Defined the author-facing destination for new commissions and
items recycled by UX-002. The workbench covers task acknowledgement, complete
MCQ and FRQ package editing, simulated document import, anchored reviewer
comments, immutable version comparison, provenance and rights capture,
preflight, resubmission to two-tutor reassessment, and qualified access to the
review carousel with self-review exclusion. Renumbered student-provided
question intake to UX-004.

**Next Owner:** Paid Tutor Authors, AP Readers, Learning Quality Owner,
accessibility, security, privacy, and rights reviewers, then David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Test the queue, editor, comments, comparison,
provenance, resubmission, and review-mode transition before any production
implementation.

## Student-Provided Question Intake Design Started - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-004
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Defined a five-stage outside-question intake covering typed,
pasted, photographed, and document inputs; extraction confirmation; possible
personal information; one-round missing-context clarification; confidence-aware
subject matching; Teach, Hint, Check My Work, and Solution modes; and a
conservative active-assessment state. Created the canonical UX specification,
task record, clickable prototype, and Lovable render brief.

**Next Owner:** Learning Quality, accessibility, security, privacy, rights, and
academic-integrity reviewers, then David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Test whether students can provide complete context,
understand confidence limits, choose the intended help mode, and distinguish
private use from anonymous improvement and separately reviewed publication.

## Question and Answer Review Portal Design Started - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-002
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Defined the staged two-tutor and AP Reader workflow for question
candidates and MCQ answer options, including aggregate-score routing, immutable
edit-and-recycle behavior, whole-package exclusion, exact-agreement difficulty
labels, reviewer independence, and the boundary between candidate approval and
production release. Created the canonical interaction design, task record,
clickable prototype, and Lovable render brief.

**Next Owner:** Tutors, AP Readers, Learning Quality Owner, accessibility and
security reviewers, and David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Review and test the carousel, score meanings,
rationale requirements, answer-package behavior, and difficulty discussion
before any production implementation.

## Drawn-Response Pilot V0 Preflight Blocked - 2026-06-13

**Tasks:** TASK-0010 / TASK-0011
**Status:** QA Blocked - Revision Required
**Summary:** Reviewed Claude's three-prompt AI-drafted pilot. The package has
the right scope, student/reviewer separation, candidate labeling, and capture
controls. Preflight found that Prompt 2's enzyme table is not reproducible from
its incomplete stated formula, Prompt 3's values do not match its logistic
equation, and the rights section cites a nonexistent Product Owner originality
approval. Standardized the P0 recommendation to SEM, symmetric error bars, an
operational plateau estimate, and a bounded linear scale. Corrected unsupported
rubric assumptions.

**Next Owner:** Claude for v0.2 remediation
**Next Required Action:** Produce a new immutable package satisfying
`prompts/CLAUDE_REMEDIATE_DRAWN_RESPONSE_PILOT_V0.md`, then return it for
deterministic recalculation, Learning Quality preflight, rights-status review,
and Product Owner decision before Orly begins.

## Orly Drawn-Response Pilot Protocol Prepared - 2026-06-13

**Tasks:** TASK-0010 / TASK-0011
**Status:** Draft internal research protocol
**Summary:** Reviewed Claude's 12-item hand-drawn AP Biology reference library.
Retained its graph-feature taxonomy and recommendation to begin with bounded
quantitative graphs, but rejected the historical official-question derivatives
as pilot prompts or gold-set seeds. Corrected overgeneralized graphing and
scoring claims. Prepared a protocol for Orly to complete three or fewer
independently authored graph prompts and submit two raw phone captures per
response.

**Next Owner:** Claude for rights-clean pilot drafting; Orly Bloom for Learning
Quality review and participation after the prompts pass review
**Next Required Action:** Claude produces three original student prompt sheets,
separate reviewer packages, provenance records, and the Orly administration
checklist defined in
`prompts/CLAUDE_REVISE_DRAWN_RESPONSE_PILOT_SET.md`.

## Official Exam Date and Registration Direction Applied - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-001
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Removed learner-entered AP exam dates from the canonical student
portal UX, clickable prototype, architecture workflow, and Lovable render
brief. The active versioned exam specification now supplies the official date,
while the learner confirms registered, not registered yet, or unsure status.
The latter two paths remain non-blocking and explain that registration happens
through the learner's school or AP coordinator.

**Next Owner:** Learning, accessibility, representative learners, and David
Bloom for review
**Next Required Action:** Review whether the three registration choices and
school/AP coordinator explanation are clear without distracting from the first
useful learning action.

## Lovable UX-001 Render Brief Prepared - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-001
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Created a self-contained Lovable build brief for rendering the
post-account student experience and related learning-session states. The brief
defines frontend routes, mock state, exact copy, branching behavior,
accessibility requirements, QA paths, and explicit prohibitions on backend
connections, production deployment, protected content, and invented product
policy.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom / Lovable operator
**Next Required Action:** Give
`prompts/LOVABLE_UX001_STUDENT_EXPERIENCE.md` to Lovable, generate a preview,
and return the preview for Learning, Marketing, accessibility, learner, and
Product Owner review.

## Post-Account Student Experience Expanded - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-001
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Expanded the first-run prototype from a single setup screen into a
five-step, recoverable post-account journey: account-ready explanation, AP
Biology exam context, immediate learner goal, available time, optional
calibration, and a transparent first-session plan. The plan changes with the
learner's choices and preserves direct-start and finish-later paths.

**Next Owner:** Learning, Marketing, accessibility, representative learners,
and David Bloom for review
**Next Required Action:** Test whether learners understand why each setup
question is asked, how it changes their plan, and whether calibration feels
optional rather than required.

## Initial Student Portal UX Work Started - 2026-06-13

**Task:** UX-001
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** David authorized the initial product UX work. Created the formal
task record and proposed student-portal interaction design covering onboarding,
session modes, the stable learning-session frame, criterion feedback, repair
and retry, learner override, Move On and return behavior, coaching copy,
uncertainty, disputed grades, progress, accessibility, prototype scope, and
research questions. Production implementation and final UX decisions remain
hard-gated.

**Next Owner:** Main Conductor for low-fidelity prototype preparation; Orly
Bloom, Micah Bloom, accessibility reviewer, and David Bloom for review
**Next Required Action:** Conduct Learning, Marketing, accessibility, and
representative learner review of `prototypes/ux-001/index.html`, then bring the
nine proposed UX decisions to David.

## Content Follow-On Tasks Defined — 2026-06-13

**Tasks:** TASK-0008 through TASK-0011
**Status:** Proposed / Research
**Summary:** Added a clean proprietary exemplar replacement, conceptual
schema-governance reconciliation, phased grader-confidence program, and
paper-first QR-linked handwritten graph-capture research. Confirmed that MCQ
and FRQ authoring proceed simultaneously and that all reviewed FRQs remain
unapproved candidates subject to edit or rejection.

**Next Owner:** Learning Quality Owner, Grading Lead, Technical Owner, and
counsel as assigned
**Next Required Action:** Review task scopes and approve execution resources and
participants where required.

## Authoring Architecture Rewritten and Experiment Defined — 2026-06-13

**Task:** TASK-0007 / CONTENT-001
**Status:** In Progress
**Summary:** Rejected the prohibited official-derived candidate, converted useful
quality lessons into abstract failure cards, preserved paid-tutor authorship as
the production baseline, and defined a blinded validation-only experiment for
alternative AI-led authoring models. Replaced stale physical-schema proposals
with an immutable prompt-build-manifest architecture and complete MCQ/FRQ
package contracts.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / Learning Quality Owner and counsel
**Next Required Action:** Review the architecture, experimental arms, source
isolation, contracts, metrics, and decision thresholds before execution.

## Visual Stimulus Architecture Review Prepared — 2026-06-12

**Task:** TASK-0006 / CONTENT-001
**Status:** Ready for Owner Review
**Summary:** Assessed the proposed structured-chart, prose-fallback, and
image-generation model. Recommended deterministic quantitative visuals,
governed authored or constrained diagrams, validated accessible equivalents,
and deferral of free-form generated scientific images. Added fail-closed,
answer-leakage, source, rights, revalidation, and learner-created graphing
requirements.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Decide the five architecture questions in
`TASK-0006`, followed by Learning Quality, accessibility, and counsel review.

## Corrected AP Biology Coverage Direction Adopted — 2026-06-12

**Task:** TASK-0005 / CONTENT-001A
**Status:** Approved direction; Learning Quality review remains
**Summary:** Reviewed Claude's coverage and schema package. Retained the
separate MCQ/FRQ targeting model but corrected the taxonomy from 48 to 60
official topics and the full target from 784 to 964 inventory items. Defined one
inventory item as one MCQ or one independently delivered FRQ prompt. Approved
expert-curated diagnostic use before empirical confirmation, required human
review for statistical signals, and deferred physical Supabase design.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / Learning Quality Owner
**Next Required Action:** Review topic-level feasibility, content variety, and
beta prioritization against the corrected matrix.

## Markdown-First Document Rule Adopted — 2026-06-12

**Task:** Operating documentation
**Status:** Approved
**Summary:** Established Markdown in GitHub as the default and canonical project
document medium. Google Docs is the preferred collaboration or backup copy.
Word is now an exception for a specific external, submission, printing, or
layout-fidelity need and is not regenerated by default.

**Next Owner:** Main Conductor
**Next Required Action:** Apply the format hierarchy to new and updated
documents and return accepted Google Docs edits to canonical Markdown.

## GitHub Synchronization Rule Adopted — 2026-06-12

**Task:** Operating documentation
**Status:** Approved
**Summary:** Required every retained local project document to be committed and
pushed to `david-bloom/Cramapple`. Added machine-local metadata exclusions and
remote-verification requirements.

**Next Owner:** Main Conductor
**Next Required Action:** Commit and push the current documentation set, then
verify the remote branch.

## Question Distribution Analysis Started — 2026-06-12

**Task:** CONTENT-001A
**Status:** Completed with corrections
**Summary:** Claude analyzed the distribution of MCQs and FRQs. Review retained
the separate question-form target model but rejected the 48-topic assumption
and 784-item total. `DECISION-0014` records the corrected 60-topic, 964-item
direction.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / Learning Quality Owner
**Next Required Action:** Review the corrected coverage matrix, topic-level
feasibility, content variety, and beta prioritization.

## Proprietary Question Bank Rules Defined — 2026-06-12

**Task:** TASK-0005 / CONTENT-001
**Status:** Approved direction with open gates
**Summary:** Defined a proprietary MCQ and FRQ bank. Quantity was later refined
by `DECISION-0014` to ten MCQs and five short-FRQ prompts per official topic
plus eight long-FRQ prompts per unit. Base packages come from paid authors or
purchases; AI may create candidate variants only from packages with explicit
derivative and model-input rights. Every variant requires a complete rubric,
teaching package, provenance, and independent validation.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / Learning Quality Owner with counsel
**Next Required Action:** Review topic-level feasibility, draft the simple
release, define permitted source and asset rules, establish the AI holdout, and
set production sample thresholds for question changes and retirement.

## Paid Tutor Question-Authoring Model Adopted — 2026-06-12

**Task:** TASK-0005 / CONTENT-001
**Status:** Approved direction; operating details in progress
**Summary:** Replaced the proposed historical-question-seeded generation model
with paid qualified tutors independently authoring original question packages
from Cramapple coverage briefs. Official College Board questions and scoring
materials are excluded from seeds, adaptation targets, few-shot examples, and
generative-model inputs.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / Learning Quality Owner
**Next Required Action:** Define tutor author qualifications, commissioning
briefs, compensation and revision terms, originality and IP agreements,
preflight checks, coverage targets, and independent validation assignments.

## Owner Review Queue Updated — 2026-06-12

**Tasks:** TASK-0001, TASK-0003, TASK-0004
**Status:** NOW-001, NOW-002, and NOW-003 Done
**Summary:** David recorded `TASK-0001` and `TASK-0003` as Done and completed
owner review of the current `TASK-0004` documentation. `TASK-0004` remains open
for the independent AP Biology tutor review required by `NOW-004`.

**Next Owner:** Orly Bloom / qualified AP Biology tutors
**Next Required Action:** Complete `NOW-004`, record findings, and determine
whether `TASK-0004` requires remediation or can be closed.

## Master Backlog Created — 2026-06-12

**Task:** Operating documentation
**Status:** Active
**Summary:** Created `docs/MASTER_TODO.md` as the canonical index of current
task closures, required designs, legal and quality gates, teaching research,
MVP implementation, commercial readiness, and deferred expansion work. Backlog
entries preserve their existing approval state and do not authorize execution.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom / Main Conductor
**Next Required Action:** Continue with `NOW-004` through `NOW-007`.

## Content Governance and Validation Procedure Prepared — 2026-06-12

**Task:** TASK-0005

**Summary:** Drafted the complete proposed operating procedure for immutable
content and rubric versions, source and rights provenance, independent teaching
and grading validation, reviewer qualifications, numeric release gates, atomic
exam-pack publication, monitoring, revalidation, retirement, rollback, and
audit.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Coordinate Learning Quality Owner and counsel review,
then approve, request changes, or reject the proposed policy and thresholds.

## Learning Boundary Questions Resolved — 2026-06-11

**Task:** TASK-0004
**Status:** Documentation revision in progress
**Summary:** Defined assessable skill targets for repeated-miss evidence; established diagnostic and instructional Frame behavior; made intervention selection recommendation-with-override; marked per-target time and stable-success thresholds for pedagogy research; and assigned public student-question publishing primarily to marketing/content with teaching and grading gates.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Review the revised documents and PR language.

## Unified Learning and Stuck-State Revision — 2026-06-10

**Task:** TASK-0004
**Status:** Documentation revision in progress
**Summary:** Replaced deterministic miss counting and universal Sideways-first routing with evidence-weighted escalation, discriminating probes, independent and delayed confirmation, learner Move On, schedule-aware Park, and skill-and-task-specific intervention effectiveness. Added explicit anonymous use of student responses to improve Cramapple, separate from public publication.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom
**Next Required Action:** Review the revised learning-system documents and the updated pull request.

## Component Architecture and Teaching Design Prepared — 2026-06-10

**Task:** TASK-0004
**Status:** Ready for Owner Review
**Summary:** Created separate canonical designs for system context and logical components, and for ten-day teaching and pedagogy. Added a versioned exam-fact boundary, AP Biology point-distribution guidance, diagnostic and improvability models, next-action logic, FRQ pedagogy, and validator requirements.

**Next Owner:** David Bloom

## DECISION-0001 — Use GitHub as Cramapple's Durable Source of Truth

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Decision Owner:** David Bloom
**Status:** Approved
**Related Task:** TASK-0001
**Area:** Operations

### Context

Cramapple planning has begun in chat and in speculative blueprint documents. Durable project state needs a consistent home and operating workflow.

### Decision

Use the AI Project Operating Kit and store canonical documents, tasks, approvals, decisions, and activity records in `david-bloom/Cramapple`.

### Rationale

This prevents chat-only decisions, establishes approval boundaries, and allows human and AI collaborators to reorient from the same records.

### Consequences

GitHub documents override unrecorded chat memory. Earlier `Blueprint_*` files remain speculative inputs unless promoted through an approved decision.

### Risks / Follow-ups

The operating workflow may need simplification after practical use.

## DECISION-0002 — Product and Strategy Authority

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Decision Owner:** David Bloom
**Status:** Approved
**Related Task:** TASK-0001
**Area:** Operations

### Context

The project needs explicit authority for product decisions and a role for strategic planning.

### Decision

David Bloom is Product Owner and final approver. Add Strategy Advisor to work with David and the co-founders on plans and business decisions.

### Rationale

The team benefits from strong strategic challenge and planning support while preserving one clear final product authority.

### Consequences

The Strategy Advisor may recommend, draft, analyze, and challenge. The role may not independently approve product scope, execution, risk, Done decisions, or launch.

### Risks / Follow-ups

The named person or agent filling the Strategy Advisor role may vary and should be recorded when assigned.

## DECISION-0003 — Allow Qualified Estimated AP Score Guidance

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Decision Owner:** David Bloom
**Status:** Approved
**Related Task:** TASK-0002
**Area:** Product

### Context

The initial vision prohibited official AP score prediction but left the role of estimated scoring unresolved. Students need understandable guidance about their likely current range and what improvement could move them forward.

### Decision

Cramapple may provide estimated AP score ranges or readiness estimates when supported by sufficient evidence. Estimates must be clearly identified as non-official, express uncertainty, disclose important evidence gaps, and connect the estimate to concrete next actions.

### Rationale

Qualified estimates can make criterion-level feedback more useful and motivating while preserving a clear distinction between Cramapple guidance and official College Board scoring.

### Consequences

The grading and recommendation systems will need evidence thresholds, confidence rules, calibration datasets, versioned estimation logic, and monitoring for systematic error. A single response must not be presented as a definitive overall AP score.

### Risks / Follow-ups

- Define the minimum evidence required before displaying an estimate.
- Establish expert review and calibration standards before launch.
- Determine how estimated ranges should be updated as new performance evidence arrives.
- Validate customer-facing language with students, parents, tutors, and legal review.
